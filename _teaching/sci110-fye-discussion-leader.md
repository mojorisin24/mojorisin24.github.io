**Semester Taught**: Fall 2015  
**Role**: Discussion Leader

SCI 110 is a seminar-style course designed to support first-year STEM students as they transition into university life and explore career paths. As a Discussion Leader, I:

- Gave weekly presentations on academic and professional pathways available to STEM majors
- Designed assignments to help students explore how their major aligned with personal interests and career goals
- Evaluated scientific poster projects and developed grading rubrics
- Held office hours to provide individual guidance and mentorship

This role emphasized mentorship, science communication, and early academic planning for undergraduate students across multiple disciplines.
