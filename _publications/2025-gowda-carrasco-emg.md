This open-access dataset whose experimental design was primarily creaeted by Carrasco, includes upper limb EMG signals and physiological data from 91 adults aged 18â€“92. Each participant performed 10 hand gestures 36 times, yielding over 32,000 trials. The dataset enables studies on how demographic factors impact EMG variability and decoding, and supports the development of fair, inclusive gesture-recognition systems.
