This randomized study examined whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over frontal or parietal regions could enhance working memory training in undergraduates. Despite earlier findings of neural effects, none of the stimulation groups showed significant behavioral improvements compared to sham, suggesting motivation and subject selection may be key factors in observing tDCS benefits.
