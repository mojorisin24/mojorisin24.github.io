I received my PhD from the Neuroscience Graduate Group at UC Davis in 2024, where I conducted EEG/ERP brainwave research at the Center for Mind and Brain. During my PhD, I published both experimental and methods based studies exploring the neural mechanisms underlying working memory, selective attention, learning, and decision-making primarily using machine learning techniques.  

Currently I am a postdoctoral scholar at UCSF in the Psychiatry department at the Weill Institute for Neurosciences working on applying multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to EEG/ERP brainwave data from clinically high risk for psychosis patients. I aim to uncover neural signatures linked to cognitive processes related to schizophrenia and push forward the development of biomarker-based tools for early detection/intervention.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, playing guitar, and having a good time with friends.
