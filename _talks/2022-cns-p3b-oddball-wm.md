Presented preliminary findings suggesting that rare, task-relevant stimuli — typically evoking a P3b component — are preferentially encoded in working memory. This talk highlighted behavioral and electrophysiological evidence showing that oddball stimuli elicit stronger working memory representations compared to frequent stimuli.

The results pointed toward a privileged status for rare events in memory encoding, possibly due to attentional prioritization or reduced proactive interference. This work later led to a peer-reviewed publication in *Psychophysiology* (2025).
