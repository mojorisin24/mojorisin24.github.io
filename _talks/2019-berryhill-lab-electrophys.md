Gave a lab seminar to the Berryhill Lab covering a broad methodological overview of human electrophysiology across multiple spatial scales. The talk traced my work beginning with single-unit recordings in humans, progressing through projects involving local field potentials (LFPs), and culminating in noninvasive scalp EEG recordings.

The presentation emphasized key methodological considerations specific to each recording technique—such as spatial resolution, signal origin, and noise characteristics—while also highlighting analytical parallels across all levels of measurement. I discussed common time-series approaches (e.g., spectral analysis, event-related averaging, multivariate decoding) and how these techniques can be adapted and interpreted across different electrophysiological domains.

The goal was to illustrate both the unique contributions and the shared challenges of analyzing neural signals across the invasive-to-noninvasive continuum.
