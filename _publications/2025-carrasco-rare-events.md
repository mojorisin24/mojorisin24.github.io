This paper provides direct evidence that working memory representations are enhanced for rare (oddball) events. Using a modified oddball paradigm and ERP recordings, the authors found that rare stimuli evoked larger P3b amplitudes, more precise memory reports, and improved neural decoding of stimulus location. A follow-up experiment controlled for proactive interference, confirming that rarity at the category level—not just instance frequency—boosts working memory fidelity. These results highlight a robust link between task-defined rarity and the quality of memory encoding.
