**Quarters Led**: Winter 2019, Spring 2019, Fall 2019  
**Role**: Discussion Leader

NSC 298 is a graduate-level journal club focused on neuroimaging methods and theory. As Discussion Leader for three quarters, I was responsible for organizing and facilitating weekly meetings centered on current topics in cognitive neuroscience.

Key contributions:
- Selected each quarter’s overarching theme (e.g., memory, attention, decision-making)
- Curated weekly readings across modalities such as fMRI, EEG, iEEG, MEG, and TMS
- Led critical discussions and structured journal evaluations
- Designed and delivered supplemental material on statistics and methodology
- Coordinated student presentations and supported peer-led discussions

The course fostered advanced critical thinking and methodological fluency in imaging research, especially during an evolving era of cognitive neuroscience.
