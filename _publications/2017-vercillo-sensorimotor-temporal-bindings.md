This study measures how aging affects the temporal binding between voluntary motor actions and their sensory consequences. Older adults exhibited reduced ability to recalibrate perception and decreased temporal sensitivity compared to younger participants, suggesting a decline in sensorimotor temporal integration with advancing age.
