**Quarters Taught**: Fall 2020, Winter 2021, Spring 2024  
**Role**: Teaching Assistant

As a TA for PSC 001Y (General Psychology), a hybrid-format introductory course, I led weekly discussion sections designed to reinforce and expand upon lecture material. Each session included interactive demonstrations and slide presentations aligned with the week’s core topics.

I met regularly with the course instructor to discuss the success of various classroom activities, assess student engagement, and iterate on the structure and content of discussions to improve teaching effectiveness across quarters.

Additional responsibilities included proctoring exams, leading exam review sessions, and providing one-on-one academic support to students.
