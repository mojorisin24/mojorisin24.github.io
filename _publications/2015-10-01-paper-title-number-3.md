This dataset includes surface electromyogram (EMG) signals and physiological measures from 91 demographically diverse adults, aged 18 to 92. Participants were selected to represent a range of body mass indices (healthy, overweight, and obese). The dataset also includes measures such as skin hydration and elasticity, which may affect EMG signals. This resource provides a basis to study demographic confounds in EMG signals and serves as a benchmark to test the development of fair and unbiased algorithms that enable accurate hand gesture decoding across diverse subjects.
