**Quarter Taught**: Spring 2021  
**Role**: Teaching Assistant

PSC 133 – NeuroEconomics is an upper-division interdisciplinary course that draws students from psychology, economics, and cognitive science. As the TA during Spring 2021 (remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic), I helped adapt the course for online delivery and supported a highly diverse student body.

My responsibilities included:
- Assisting students with varying levels of background knowledge in neuroscience and economics
- Grading quizzes and evaluating final projects
- Leading exam review sessions
- Supporting the instructor in refining course delivery for online learning

A major focus was on bridging gaps in students’ prior knowledge and making complex brain-based decision-making content accessible across disciplines.
