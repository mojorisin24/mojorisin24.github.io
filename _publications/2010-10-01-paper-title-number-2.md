This dataset offers comprehensive upper limb surface electromyogram (EMG) signals and physiological measurements from 91 demographically diverse adults aged 18 to 92 years. Participants performed ten distinct hand gestures, each repeated 36 times, resulting in a total of 32,760 trials. The dataset includes EMG recordings from 12 electrodes placed on the forearm and wrist, along with demographic and physiological data such as age, BMI, skin hydration, skin elasticity, subcutaneous fat, and hair density.

The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate research into how demographic factors influence EMG signal variability and gesture decoding performance. By providing a diverse participant pool, the dataset enables the development and evaluation of fair and unbiased machine learning algorithms for EMG-based gesture recognition systems.

The dataset is publicly available and can serve as a benchmark for studies aiming to improve the inclusivity and generalizability of EMG-based human-computer interaction technologies.
