I received my Ph.D. from the Neuroscience Graduate Group at UC Davis in 2024, where I conducted EEG/ERP research at the Center for Mind and Brain. During my PhD, I published both experimental and methodological studies exploring the neural mechanisms underlying working memory, selective attention, learning, and decision-making primarily using machine learning techniques. 

Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF working on applying MVPA to EEG data from schizophrenia patients, aiming to uncover neural signatures linked to cognitive processes and push forward the development of biomarker-based tools for early detection and intervention.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, playing guitar, and having a good time with friends.
